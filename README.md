# Card Memory - React

## Usage

Import `Game` and inject `<Game />` with the following props:

- `size`: the height and width
- `colors`: an array of the colors to be used for the cards, e.g. `['red', 'green', 'blue']`
- `number`: the number of cards to be used, a perfect square (the game is always square currently)
